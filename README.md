# Material Incognito Light Theme

**Windows 10 users - please go to chrome://flags, scroll down to Custom-drawn Windows 10 Titlebar and press Enable. This will enable titlebar colour.**

A theme that removes the dark Incognito Mode colour scheme from Chrome.

With the release of Material Design in Google Chrome, Incognito mode uses a dark colour scheme to distinguish it from normal mode. This theme removes and replaces it with the light colour scheme from normal mode.

Please leave comments about my theme if you wish to; I enjoy seeing feedback.

For users that wish to have the dark colour scheme be applied throughout the whole browser instead, please install Material Incognito Dark Theme.
